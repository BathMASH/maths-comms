"],["assessment-information.html", "Assessment information", " Assessment information Assessment credit breakdown. The Assessment of the course will be based around two Mathematical Interactions (MI’s). A Mathematical Interaction (MI) is defined as the communication of mathematics to an audience. Typically: MI1 is an Ri Masterclass, planned and delivered as a group. MI2 is an option from video, article or school placement, planned and delivered as an individual or pair. Each of the two MI’s will be summatively assessed in two parts: The live And recorded delivery; 25% of the overall course mark The written evaluation; 25% of the overall course mark Overall this is how the marks for the course will be allocated: .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-f7v4{background-color:#c0c0c0;border-color:#000000;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-mfjn{background-color:#333333;border-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-iks7{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#000000;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} Delivery Evaluation report Mathematical Interaction 1 25% 25% Mathematical Interaction 2 25% 25% The assessment criteria for each part can be found in Assessment submission topic file on moodle or in the list below titled Assessment Criteria. Coursework cover sheet. Set: When issued: 9.2.23 12:15. Due: Deadline: 28.4.23 11:59pm. Estimated time required: The coursework should take no more than 30 hours to complete. This is an upper bound and most students will complete the written report in less time. Submission: Submit to the moodle page as a PDF; Your candidate name and number be included. Conditions: The report is an individual submission. Value: This written assignment carries 50% of the total marks for the course.This assignment will be marked out of 50 where 25 marks are available for each section detailed on the assessment criteria. Length: There is a word count of 2500 words, 1250 words for your evaluation of Mathematical Interaction 1 and 1250 word for your evaluation of Mathemametical Interaction 2. Support and advice: You can ask you mentor for advice up until the deadline day in the designated mentoring sessions. Feedback: You will receive your marks for the unit at the same time as your other modules. Late submission of coursework: If there are valid circumstances preventing you from meeting the deadline, your Director of Studies may grant you an extension to the specified submission date, if it is requested before the deadline. Forms to request an extension are available on SAMIS. If you submit a piece of work after the submission date, and no extension has been granted, the maximum mark possible will be the pass mark. If you submit work more than five working days after the submission date, you will normally receive a mark of 0 (zero), unless you have been granted an extension. Academic integrity statement: Academic misconduct is defined by the University as “the use of unfair means in any examination or assessment procedure”. This includes (but is not limited to) cheating, collusion, plagiarism, fabrication, or falsification. The University’s Quality Assurance Code of Practice, QA53 Examination and Assessment Offences, sets out the consequences of committing an offence and the penalties that might be applied. Contact details: Tamsin Smith Room: 6W1.28 E-mail: t.l.smith@bath.ac.uk Group Contributions. Group Contribution Rating (GCR) For the elements of the course where you will present material as a group, group members must agree on one another’s relative contribution to their coursework. We will assume that groups agree to an even allocation of marks across the group unless a Group Contribution Form (GCF) is submitted to the unit convener. The Group Contribution Form (GCF) The GCF is available on the Moodle page and records how well individual members have contributed to the coursework throughout the coursework period. The final GCF is a one-page document with every group member’s name, signature and agreed assessment of their percentage contribution to the coursework over the whole coursework period. In the case that recorded percentage contributions are exceptionally high or low, the GCF document should include a brief paragraph of explanation. (An example can be found Assessment submission topic file). The signed GCF must be submitted to the unit convener after the live delivery. If no agreement can be reached on the contributions of individual members, the group can hand in more than one GCF, but members will be required to produce evidence in a hearing with the unit convener to support their argument. In such an eventuality, the Director of Teaching may also be involved. The GCF will directly inform the allocation of marks to each individual group member. Assessment Criteria. Live and recorded delivery descriptors. Grid A will be used to mark the content of each Mathematical Interaction (which could be one of the below items): COMPULSORY - Masterclasses: Live delivery - in groups \\(~\\) OPTION - Written article suitable for Chalkdust, published on Medium - individual work OPTION - Video published on YouTube, e.g. similar in style to Numberphile, StandupMaths, 3Blue1Brown. Maximum 2 in group. OPTION - School placement to be arranged in local school (limited availability) Written Evaluation descriptors Grid B will be used to mark the written evaluation of each Mathematical Interaction. See below for Grid A and B, please note that a one page pdf document of these tables is available on moodle.
